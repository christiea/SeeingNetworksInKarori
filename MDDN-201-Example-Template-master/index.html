			<h1>Antenna</h1>
			<p>An antenna is a rod, wire or other device used to transit or receive electromagnetic waves by converting electrical power into electromagnetic waves vice versa. Antenna provide a wireless option for extending and giving access to wifi. Wireless communication is the transfer of information from one object to another, with no physical object connecting them. RF or radio waves sent via these antenna create a wireless networking system.</p>

				<h3>Yagi-Uda Television Antenna</h3>
				<p>This type of antenna is commonly used for televisional antennas. It is for long distance shortwave communication by shortwave broadcasting stations and radio amateurs.</p>

				<h3>Satellite Dish</h3>
				<p>Properly named as a dish because of it's shape, a satellite dish is a type of parabolic antenna. This form of antenna is designed to transmit and receive information by radio waves to our communication satellite.</p>

		<section id=Cables>
			<h1>Cables</h1>
			<p>Cables insulated wire or wires that have a protective casing. The cables transmit electricity or telecommunication.Their role is to carry video and audio signals between devices, like; DVD players and TVs, Stereo Receivers and Speakers, and computers and video projectors. The internet is connected by cables. There are a few options when it comes to which cable to use. Fiber- optoc cable is the fastest choice; operating at 940 Megabits per second (MBPS), it is considered to be the most reliable. Cable connection is often shared amongst your neighbors, making it slightly less secure then the other options. Digital Subscriber Line or DSL connection, uses an already existing copper wire connected to your phone line.</p>

				<h3>Single Fiber Cable</h3>
				<p>One mode of light travels and reflects through the core. It has a small diametral core. Signals are able to travel further.</p>

				<h3>Multimode Fiber Cable</h3>
				<p>Like, fiber this allows the light pass through the cable. It has a large diameter and allows more types of data to be transmitted.</p>

		<section id=Manholes>
			<h1>Manholes</h1>
			<p>Manholes (a.k.a maintanence hole cover) is a removable lid covering access point large enough opening for a person to enter the underground system that contains covered antennas. 5G implemented the use of hiding the often unsightly cell infrastructure placed onto water towers and church steeples. These are a very good way to discretely connect networks and take away the eyesores of these large unnecessary structures. You will find these in many designs, depending on the location and purpose for the manhole. They are designed to be too heavy for unauthorized access to be discouraged and stopped.</p>

		<section id=PowerLines>
			<h1>PowerLines</h1>
			<p>PowerLines are held between the large towers or poles you see everyday, they are a set of conductors. They transmit and distribute electrical energy. In old homes or rural areas where getting wifi access is costly the BPL (Broadband over powerlines) or EOP (Ethernet over powerlines) gives you a cheaper way to bring the wifi into your home. You will see these on mostly every street with residential or business properties.</p>
